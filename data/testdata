This is a test. Mr. 7th decided it would be a good idea. This is not Mr. idea's idea.
How did Mr. 7th decide it was a good idea? Because he simply knows, of course.
Now I'm trying to decide if I am able to break the random text loader. It seems like a neat thing to do.
Neat things are ordered and structured. Mr. idea is good at making ordered and structured things, but not at ideas.
